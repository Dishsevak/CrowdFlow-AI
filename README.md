CrowdFlow – AI-Powered Real-Time Crowd Density Monitoring System 👥📊

CrowdFlow is an AI-driven crowd monitoring system that detects, analyzes, and visualizes real-time crowd density using a live camera feed or uploaded video.
It helps users understand how crowded a place is by classifying the area into Low, Moderate, or High crowd levels — useful for events, public places, college festivals, malls, exhibitions, and smart-city projects.

🚀 Features
📸 Real-Time Crowd Detection
Uses computer vision to count people and estimate density.

🧠 AI Classification (Low / Medium / High)
Automatically categorizes crowd levels using a trained model.

🎛️ Interactive User Dashboard
Clean UI to display live status with colors & animations.

🌐 Map-Based or Section-Based Visualization
Users can select a zone/area to check crowd condition.

📎 Upload Video Option
If no webcam, upload a clip to analyze crowd.

⚡ Fast & Lightweight Frontend (React + Vite)
Smooth performance with modern design.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Technology
Frontend	React.js, Vite, TailwindCSS
Backend (optional)	Flask / Node.js
AI Model	OpenCV, TensorFlow / YOLO
Tools	VS Code, GitHub

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies
npm install

2. Start development server
npm run dev


Project will start at:
👉 http://localhost:5173

🧪 How Crowd Detection Works

Video frame is captured

People detection model processes the frame

Head/Body bounding boxes are counted

Density = total individuals in frame

Category assigned:

0–5 → Low

6–15 → Medium

16+ → High

🎯 Use Cases

Event management & monitoring

Campus / college crowd control

Shopping malls

Stadiums & concerts

Smart city crowd analytics

Safety surveillance

Queue monitoring

Public-space management
